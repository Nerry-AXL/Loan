Here’s a polished and comprehensive `README.md` template tailored for your **Loan** repository. This template assumes a loan risk prediction model with an API—you can adapt as needed.

# Loan Risk Predictor

A robust **Loan Risk Prediction** tool that trains a machine learning model to assess loan default probability and exposes it via a REST API.

---

## 📦 Features

- **Data ingestion & preprocessing** of loan dataset (e.g., LendingClub)
- **Model training** with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Network
- **Model evaluation** using common metrics (accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix)
- **Flask REST API** for real-time predictions
- **Web frontend** for interactive loan input and risk output
- **Docker support** for easy deployment

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- pip
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose

---

### 2. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nerry-AXL/Loan.git
cd Loan
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

### 3. Data

Place your loan dataset (e.g. `loans.csv`) into a `data/` folder.
Expected columns:

```
loan_amount, term, interest_rate, credit_score, annual_income, purpose, defaulted
```

---

### 4. Train Model

```bash
python train_model.py \
  --data data/loans.csv \
  --model-output models/loan_model.pkl \
  --metrics-output reports/metrics.json
```

Outputs:

* `loan_model.pkl`: Trained model serialized
* `metrics.json`: Performance metrics & plots

---

### 5. Run the API

```bash
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
# Access at http://localhost:5000
```

Endpoints:

* `POST /predict` – Accepts JSON loan application data, returns default probability
* `GET /health` – API health check

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"loan_amount":20000,"term":36,"interest_rate":13.56,"credit_score":720,"annual_income":75000,"purpose":"debt_consolidation"}'
```

---

### 6. Web UI (Optional)

If included, start the frontend:

```bash
python app.py
```

Use your browser to submit loan data and view prediction results.

---

### 7. Docker (Optional)

```bash
docker build -t loan-predictor:latest .
docker run -p 5000:5000 loan-predictor:latest
```

---

## 🧠 Model & Approach

* **Algorithms considered:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network
* **Best model:** Random Forest (voted for performance & interpretability)
* Feature engineering: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
* Evaluation: ROC-AUC, precision, recall, confusion matrix

## ✅ Usage Summary

1. Install dependencies
2. (Optional) Prepare `data/loans.csv`
3. `python train_model.py` to train
4. `flask run` to start the API
5. POST to `/predict` with loan data

---

## 🎯 Roadmap & Enhancements

* Add **authentication**/authorization for API access
* Deploy to **Heroku/Vercel/AWS**
* Extend support to **DOCX/Excel** input and output reports
* Integrate **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions
* Add **explainability** (e.g., LIME/SHAP)

✅ **Next steps:**
- Replace placeholders (like `train_model.py`, model type, API routes) with actual filenames and implementation details.
- Add screenshots or sample responses if your repo includes a frontend or API examples.
- Include badges (build, coverage, license) at the top once CI/CD is enabled.
